Q-1 Create a query to display the room, description, facility type, room capacity and order it by facility type.
    Now create one field which gives the description whether the room is on ground floor, first floor etc.
    If room consists of '0' at 1st place then it is on Ground Floor.
    If room consists of '1' at 1st place then it is on First Floor.
    If room consists of '2' at 1st place then it is on Second Floor.
    If room consists of '3' at 1st place then it is on Third floor.
    If room consists of '4' at 1st place then it is on Fourth Floor.
    If room consists of '5' at 1st place then it is on Fifth Floor.
    And select the data of only those rooms which have room length as three. Use Table: FACILITY_TBL

Ans -: select a.ROOM, a.DESCRIPTION , a.FACILITY_TYPE , a.ROOM_CAPACITY ,
     CASE   
        When ROOM like '0%' Then  'Ground Floor' 
        When ROOM like '1%' Then  'First Floor'
        When ROOM like '2%' Then  'Second Floor'
        When ROOM like '3%' Then  'Third Floor'
        When ROOM like '4%' Then  'Fourth Floor'
        When ROOM like '5%' Then  'Fifth Floor'
        else 'Unkown Floor'
      END as Floor_description
      from  ps_FACILITY_TBL a where LENGTH(ROOM)=3 and 
      a.EFFDT= (select max(A_FT.EFFDT) from ps_FACILITY_TBL A_FT where A_FT.FACILITY_ID=a.FACILITY_ID)
      and a.EFF_STATUS='A'
      order by FACILITY_TYPE ;

Q-2 Create a query to select First_name_srch ,last_name_srch,Father's
    name,acad_prog,acad_plan,admit_term,admit_type,academic_level,email_addr,phone,address,
    gender,reg_region,religion_cd,prog_action fields.
    The Address field will be single filed that will comprise of address1, adress2,address3,address4,city
    fields and replace the ','(Comma) with a space in address field.
    The tables from which you will have to select these data are:
    ADM_PRSPCT_CAR
    PERSONAL_DATA
    ADM_PRSPCT_PROG
    ADM_PRSPCT_Plan
    RELATIONSHIPS
    SRMU_REGN_CASTE
    ADDRESSES
    EMAIL_ADDRESSES
    ACAD_PROG
    Also include 2 conditions as people_relation='FA' and prog_action='MATR' Note: All data should come
    that is present in table ADM_PRSPCT_CAR even if there is no data in other tables.
