QTD = TOTALQTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date])
YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date])

Q14. How do you compare sales of the current month with the same month last year?

SalesLastYear = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))

Q15. How to calculate number of active clients in any selected month?
Answer:

ActiveClients = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Client[ClientID]),
    FILTER(Client,
        Client[StartDate] <= MAX('Date'[Date]) &&
        (ISBLANK(Client[EndDate]) || Client[EndDate] >= MIN('Date'[Date]))
    )
)
